# Project AI Guidance

This repository is a learning project for building a small internal-platform-style ECS service template with TypeScript application code, AWS CDK infrastructure code, and ECS/Fargate deployment concepts.

The user is learning TypeScript, NestJS, AWS CDK, and platform engineering. Understanding is part of the deliverable: keep explanations concrete, tie them to actual files, and explain tradeoffs instead of hiding them behind broad abstractions.

## Repository Layout

- `movie-reservation-service/`: NestJS TypeScript backend. Keep NestJS in bootstrap, DI, controllers, and GraphQL resolvers; keep domain and application code plain TypeScript where possible.
- `ecs-infra/`: AWS CDK TypeScript workspace. Explain how constructs map to CloudFormation and AWS resources.
- `docs/`: project documentation. Start at `docs/index.md`; save implementation plans under `docs/plans/`.
- `.ai/`: source of truth for AI guidance, rules, skills, and review agents. `AGENTS.md` is generated from this folder by `.ai/sync.sh`.

## Dev Environment Tips

- Use `npm`, not pnpm or yarn.
- This is an npm workspace repo with `movie-reservation-service` and `ecs-infra` workspaces.
- Prefer workspace commands from the repo root, for example `npm -w movie-reservation-service run check`.
- Check the relevant `package.json` before inventing commands or assuming tooling.
- Read existing docs and source before asking questions the repository can answer.

## Build And Test Commands

- Root build: `npm run build`
- Root tests: `npm test`
- Root lint: `npm run lint`
- Service dev server: `npm -w movie-reservation-service run dev`
- Service full check: `npm -w movie-reservation-service run check`
- Service typecheck: `npm -w movie-reservation-service run typecheck`
- Service tests: `npm -w movie-reservation-service test`
- Service focused test: `npm -w movie-reservation-service test -- -t "<test name>"`
- Infra build: `npm -w ecs-infra run build`
- Infra tests: `npm -w ecs-infra test`
- CDK commands: `npm -w ecs-infra run cdk -- <args>`

Run the narrowest useful check while iterating, then run the relevant full check before handing work back.

## Code And Architecture Conventions

- Prefer small, incremental changes that fit existing project structure.
- Do not over-engineer early abstractions; extract patterns only after the duplication or boundary is real.
- The service is NestJS now. Do not introduce Fastify or Express route patterns unless explicitly asked to revisit the HTTP adapter.
- Keep framework decorators and DI wiring at the edges. Domain types, application services, ports, and repositories should stay plain TypeScript where possible.
- Use explicit, readable TypeScript types when they improve clarity.
- Distinguish compile-time TypeScript safety from runtime validation. Use Zod or framework validation at external boundaries.
- For infrastructure, explain what AWS resource is being modeled and how CDK code maps to deployed infrastructure.
- Roadmap technologies such as PostgreSQL, Knex, SQS, Kubernetes, and k3d should only be introduced in the phase that calls for them.

## Planning Guidance

- For non-trivial features, refactors, integrations, migrations, infrastructure changes, or architecture changes, plan before implementing.
- Use the `principal-engineer-planner` skill for ambiguous, cross-cutting, risky, or design-heavy work.
- Do not implement from vague requirements when a short planning pass would materially reduce risk.
- Prefer the smallest design that satisfies the requirements and fits existing project conventions.
- Save implementation plans under `docs/plans/`.

## Testing Guidance

- Add or update tests for behavior changes.
- Service tests use Vitest; HTTP/e2e-style tests use Supertest.
- Infra tests use Jest and CDK assertions.
- Prefer fake-first tests and small real integration boundaries over brittle over-mocking.
- After moving files or changing imports, run typecheck/lint/tests for the affected workspace.

## Security And Operations

- Do not commit secrets, credentials, tokens, or local `.env` values.
- Treat IAM, networking, public exposure, auth, validation, and logging choices as explicit design decisions.
- Keep health and readiness endpoints simple and platform-friendly.
- Avoid adding AWS resources, public endpoints, databases, queues, or background workers without a plan and a rollback/removal path.

## Documentation And Review

- Update docs for user-facing behavior, architecture decisions, operations, or developer workflow changes.
- Use `docs/architecture/architecture-decisions.md` for durable architectural decisions.
- Use `docs/workflows/curated-technology-resources.md` for the expanded resource list.
- PR or review summaries should explain what changed, why it changed, and how it was verified.

## Curated Technology Resources

Prefer these project-approved sources over generic training-data patterns or random tutorials. Keep this list compact; use `docs/workflows/curated-technology-resources.md` for the expanded version.

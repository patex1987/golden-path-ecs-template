# 35-Day TypeScript & CDK Learning Path

This plan is designed for someone with a full-time job and a family.
The goal is not perfection. The goal is steady, compounding progress and one strong project that makes you feel dangerous on day 1.

## Ground rules

- Target **60–120 minutes on weekdays**
- Target **2–4 hours total on weekends**
- Prefer consistency over heroics
- Every day should end with one tiny output: a commit, a note, a diagram, or a passing test
- Keep a running `notes.md` in the repo with:
  - what I learned
  - what confused me
  - what I would standardize as a platform engineer

## Weekly themes

- **Week 1:** TypeScript + Node backend foundations
- **Week 2:** CDK foundations + AWS mental model
- **Week 3:** ECS/Fargate + deployment + observability
- **Week 4:** Turn the project into a platform-style golden path
- **Week 5:** Cert lens + polish + confidence building

---

## Minimal daily fallback plan

When life gets busy, do this instead of skipping:
- 15 min reading
- 20 min coding
- 5 min notes

That still counts.

## Nice-to-have extras

If you have extra energy:
- add GitHub Actions
- add a small DynamoDB table
- add synthetic checks
- add canary deployment notes
- add cost notes
- add an internal service template generator

## What “done enough” looks like

By the end, you should have:
- a TypeScript backend you understand
- a CDK app in TypeScript
- an ECS/Fargate deployment
- observability basics
- a reusable platform abstraction
- documentation written like a platform team
- enough AWS cert context to sound structured and calm

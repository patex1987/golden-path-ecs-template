# Movie Reservation Domain Vocabulary

This document defines the shared language for the movie reservation service.
The terms are intentionally concrete so code, GraphQL schema, tests, and future
database tables use the same mental model.

## Core Terms

### Movie Provider

A `MovieProvider` is the tenant-like owner of movie reservation data.

Examples:

- a cinema chain
- a local cinema operator
- a demo tenant in local seed data

Movies, auditoriums, screenings, seats, reservation requests, and reservations
belong to a movie provider. In application code, `movieProviderId` is the
tenant boundary and should come from the authenticated actor, not normal client
input.

### Movie

A `Movie` is the title and metadata that a movie provider can schedule.

Current fields include title, rating, and duration. A movie by itself is not a
showing. It becomes bookable only when it is attached to a screening.

### Auditorium

An `Auditorium` is a physical room owned by a movie provider.

It is the place where a screening happens. Seats belong to an auditorium, not
directly to a movie.

### Screen

`Screen` is a common cinema word, but the current code does not model it as a
separate entity.

For now, when we say "screen" casually, we usually mean the auditorium or room.
If the domain later needs projector/screen hardware, screen size, format, or
premium screen types, we can add a separate `Screen` concept deliberately.

### Screening

A `Screening` is a scheduled showing of one movie in one auditorium during a
specific time window.

It connects:

- movie provider
- movie
- auditorium
- start time
- end time

This is the object users browse when choosing when to watch a movie.

### Seat

A `Seat` is a reservable position inside an auditorium.

In the current model, a seat has a row and number. During reservation flows, a
seat becomes meaningful together with a screening: reserving seat `A1` means
reserving that auditorium seat for a specific screening.

### Reservation Request

A `ReservationRequest` is the user's intent to reserve one or more seats for a
screening.

It exists before the system has produced the final confirmed reservation. This
supports an asynchronous workflow:

```text
client asks to reserve seats
service creates ReservationRequest in REQUESTED state
client polls reservationRequestStatus(id)
processor later confirms, rejects, or fails the request
```

The request owns workflow status such as `REQUESTED`, `PROCESSING`,
`CONFIRMED`, `REJECTED`, and `FAILED`.

Reservation request processing also has internal ordering metadata. In D5 this
is a FIFO sequence. The sequence is deliberately hidden from GraphQL clients
and is not part of the `ReservationRequest` domain model, but it is useful
application-owner observability metadata for debugging processing order, stuck
work, and processor failures. Later durable implementations may use different
technology-specific ordering metadata, but they should preserve an
operator-visible way to troubleshoot ordering and stuck work.

In D5, the same service process owns both sides of the workflow. Later durable
phases can split this into a control plane and data plane: the GraphQL API
creates reservation requests and exposes status/result reads, while a separate
worker runtime claims and processes pending requests against the same durable
source of truth.

Current D5 behavior is intentionally all-or-nothing: if any requested seat is
already confirmed for the screening, the processor rejects the whole request.
This is a short-term simplification for the in-process processor contract, not
the desired long-term customer experience. A later product/design pass should
decide whether to offer partial confirmation, alternative seats, or explicit
user choice when only some requested seats are unavailable.

`FAILED` is also a short-term D5 terminal state. It means the in-process
processor hit an unexpected internal failure after claiming the request. D5
does not retry failed requests, reclaim stuck `PROCESSING` requests, or expose a
dead-letter workflow. Later durable worker/database phases should add retry
policy, claim leases or timeouts, and operator-facing failure handling.

The current GraphQL read contract also has a short-term simplification:
`reservationRequestStatus(id)` and `reservationResult(requestId)` are nullable.
That keeps the early API small, but it is not production-quality if `null`
means many different things. A later GraphQL contract should use explicit
typed results or deliberate GraphQL errors so clients can distinguish pending,
rejected, failed, not-found, unauthorized/hidden, and successful cases without
guessing.

### Reservation

A `Reservation` is the durable confirmed result of a successful reservation
request.

It represents that specific seats are reserved for a specific screening by a
specific user. Future durable persistence must prevent two confirmed
reservations from claiming the same seat for the same screening.

## Relationship Summary

```text
MovieProvider
  owns Movies
  owns Auditoriums
  owns Screenings
  owns ReservationRequests
  owns Reservations

Auditorium
  contains Seats

Screening
  schedules one Movie
  happens in one Auditorium
  has a time window

ReservationRequest
  asks for Seats on one Screening
  has workflow status

Reservation
  confirms Seats on one Screening
  is produced from a successful ReservationRequest
```

## Naming Guidance

- Use `movieProviderId` for tenant/provider scope in service code.
- Use `Auditorium` for the room concept.
- Avoid adding `Screen` as a code type until the domain needs a separate screen
  concept.
- Use `Screening` for a scheduled showing.
- Use `ReservationRequest` for the command/status object.
- Use `Reservation` for the confirmed result.
- Use GraphQL `reservationRequestStatus(id)` when fetching the command/status
  object.
- Use GraphQL `reservationResult(requestId)` when fetching the final booking
  result produced by a confirmed request.
